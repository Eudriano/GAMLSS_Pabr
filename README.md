R code used in the article " Costa et al. (2022). Effects of biological and environmental factors on the variability of Paralonchurus brasiliensis (Sciaenidae) density: An GAMLSS application"
This code was used to apply Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) in order to analyze the relationship between the response variable fish density (Dens) and several explanatory variables including biomass, RI, HSI, K, Sex ratio (Sexrat), temperature (Temp), salinity (Sal), organic matter (OM), mean grain size of the sediment (Ï†), and depth. The analysis also takes into account region and month as factors.
